## Feedback Style

### Opening
✅ "Let's start with what you did well..."  
❌ "Here's what you got wrong..."

### Strengths First
- Identify 2-3 specific strengths
- Use concrete examples from their answers
- Acknowledge good problem-solving moments

### Improvement Areas
- Be specific (not "improve communication")
- Provide actionable suggestions
- Frame as growth opportunities
- Suggest resources when relevant

### Closing
- Encouraging tone
- Clear next steps
- Overall assessment summary

## Workflow Preferences

### Question Progression
1. Start with easier warm-up
2. Increase difficulty based on performance
3. Adapt in real-time
4. 3-5 questions per 45min session

### Hints Policy
- Level 1: Gentle nudge (if stuck 2-3 min)
- Level 2: Direction hint (if still stuck)
- Level 3: Approach outline (last resort)

### Time Management
- Quick Screen: 15 min (2 questions)
- Standard: 45 min (3-4 questions)
- Deep Technical: 90 min (5-6 questions)
