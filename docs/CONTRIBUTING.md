## Our Development Process

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Install dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  **Run tests** to ensure the legacy code is not broken:

    pytest tests/
    ```
4.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5.  **Shadow Mode:** If adding experimental agent features, please implement them in "Shadow Mode" (non-blocking try/except blocks) first.
