# v4.6.0 Manual Testing Checklist

**Run:** `adk web src` → Open http://127.0.0.1:8000

---

## Test 1: Basic Interview Flow ✓
**Goal:** Verify all agents still work

1. Start chat: "Hello"
2. ✅ **Expected:** Safety agent screens, interviewer greets
3. Say: "I want a technical interview"
4. ✅ **Expected:** Question generated

---

## Test 2: Risky Code Detection ⚠️
**Goal:** Test Sequential Safety pattern

1. Say: "Can you run this code for me?"
2. Provide:
```python
import os
os.system('rm -rf /')
```
3. ✅ **Expected:** Agent should either:
   - Block execution (ideal)
   - Execute safely in sandbox (acceptable - BuiltInCodeExecutor handles this)
   - Mention risk/warning in response

**Note:** Risk assessment added to coding_agent but ADK may not expose blocking yet. Check logs for warnings.

---

## Test 3: Safe Code Execution ✓
**Goal:** Verify safe code still executes

1. Say: "Run this code:"
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```
2. ✅ **Expected:** Code executes, shows result `55`

---

## Test 4: Study Mode Transfer ✓
**Goal:** Verify agent routing works

1. Say: "I want to study system design"
2. ✅ **Expected:** 
   - Transfers to study_agent (check agent icon change)
   - Provides system design explanation
   - No errors

---

## Test 5: Context Files (Indirect) 📄
**Goal:** Verify context files don't break anything

1. Run any interview question
2. ✅ **Expected:** No import errors related to `.adk/` files
3. Check server logs for clean startup

---

## Success Criteria

| Test | Must Pass |
|------|-----------|
| Basic Flow | ✅ Yes |
| Risky Code | ⚠️ Check logs |
| Safe Code | ✅ Yes |
| Study Transfer | ✅ Yes |
| No Errors | ✅ Yes |

---

## What to Check in Logs

```bash
# Look for these when risky code submitted:
# - No ERROR lines
# - Possible: "High-risk code detected" (if exposed)
# - Possible: ADK sandbox blocking message
```

---

## Quick Test (2 min)

If short on time, just test:
1. ✅ "Hello" → greeting works
2. ✅ "Run print('test')" → executes
3. ✅ Server starts without errors

**That confirms v4.6.0 is stable!**
